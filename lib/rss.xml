<br><br>
Attributes or fitness domains are things like maximal-strength, speed, strength-endurance or aerobic capacity.  Tools are things like bench press, sandbags, kettle bells, hills, and your body weight. For the operational athlete, training is about improving the attribute, not about getting better at using the tool.
<br>
There’s block periodization wherein you focus on mostly one fitness domain at a time before moving on to the next. For example, block 1 would be several weeks focused on aerobic base building, block two might be maximal-strength and work capacity, and block 3 could be sport specific drills.
<br>
Periodization can also refer to how you manipulate frequency/volume and<br>
progression within the context of strength training. [eg <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_overload" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_overload" target="_blank">Progressive Overload</a>]
<br>
Periodization gives you a plan. Before you set foot in the gym, you’ll know what exercises to perform, number of sets, number of reps and load.

 <br>SPC Shoemaker in collaboration with SPC Hammack<br>
v20241231<br>In this plan I present an actionable guide to PT programming for the crew that aligns with well known principals of physical training to make us stronger, faster, and more durable. At minimum we should run 3 workouts per week that respectively target Max Strength, Aerobic Fitness, and Work Capacity. For Strength &amp; Aerobic Fitness the crew should be divided into training groups based on measured ability for that particular domain.<br><br>
<br>The minimum allotted time for crew PT is 3h / week per Lt. Col. Riley.
<br>The pairing of training stimulus followed by sufficient recovery yields physical improvement.
<br>Progressive Overload training is how to developing Maximum Strength efficiently.
<br>Endurance training at Aerobic Threshold effort is optimal for developing Aerobic Fitness.
<br>Max Strength and Aerobic Fitness are the foundation of exceptional Work Capacity.<a data-footref="1" href="https://george-a-shoemaker.github.io/mhc1/about:blank#fn-1-6766478f9e2d48a0" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a>
<br>All workouts must explicitly target one of the following domains of fitness:

<br>Maximum Strength
<br>Aerobic Fitness
<br>Work Capacity


<br>While training will sometimes be uncomfortable to achieve a sufficient stimulus, no single workout should break off a crew member. When we PT in the morning we must keep fire ready for the day. Excessive fatigue, vomiting, and pushing through acute pain are to be avoided. Such max efforts must be reserved for infrequent tests (Type Out), competitions (Stand Down), or an exceptional situation in the field where an absolute max effort is justified by the danger of the situation.  <br><br>
<br>Progressive Overload: In strength training, this is the principal of adding more resistance over time in order to stimulate continued adaption and build strength efficiently.
<br>Aerobic Fitness: The body's ability to effectively supply oxygen to muscles during sustained exercise such as hiking, cutting line, running at a steady pace, etc. Also responsible for resetting the anaerobic energy system after a short explosive effort.
<br>Anaerobic Fitness: The body's ability to deliver short bursts of energy in the absence of oxygen. Examples include sprinting, HIIT, or moving heavy objects explosively.
<br>Aerobic Threshold: A sustained effort just above the "optimal endurance training zone" and below an anaerobic effort.<a data-footref="2" href="https://george-a-shoemaker.github.io/mhc1/about:blank#fn-2-6766478f9e2d48a0" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a> A rule of thumb is to run at the limit of nasal breathing. This idea is similar to "Zone 2" or Long Steady State training.

<br><img alt="cucuzella-zones.png" src="https://george-a-shoemaker.github.io/mhc1/lib/media/cucuzella-zones.png">


<br>Work capacity: "[T]he ability to recover quickly and use multiple muscle groups requiring your cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and central nervous system to work together efficiently".<a data-footref="3" href="https://george-a-shoemaker.github.io/mhc1/about:blank#fn-3-6766478f9e2d48a0" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a> This is critical for Wildland Firefighters who must perform dynamic physical tasks for prolonged periods.
<br>Stimulus-Fatigue-Recovery-Adaptation (SFRA) Theory: The key idea is that fatigue induced by a training stimulus decreases apparent performance in the short term. Only with adequate rest is an increase in physical ability (Supercompensation) achieved.<a data-footref="4" href="https://george-a-shoemaker.github.io/mhc1/about:blank#fn-4-6766478f9e2d48a0" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[4]</a> Adaptation does not require total rest, however. You can target different stimulus day to day. One total rest day / week is advisable.

<br><img alt="sfra-curve.png" src="https://george-a-shoemaker.github.io/mhc1/lib/media/sfra-curve.png">


<br><br>Given that we are allotted 3h / week minimum for crew PT, it makes sense to run a workout on Monday / Wednesday / Friday. The three workouts are purposefully very different to provide specific stimulus for Strength, Aerobic Fitness and Work capacity respectively:<br>Monday: Max Strength Specific lifting sessions will be designed by SPC Hammack and follow a cycle targeting Push, Pull, or Leg movements each week. Workouts will consist of 3 movements for 3-5 sets of 5-12 reps to optimize for Max Strength. Sufficient rest between sets to reset the body and maintain form is critical. For heavy dynamic movements, weight is assigned as a percentage of estimated 1 Repetition Maximum and should gradually increase overtime (Progressive Overload).<br>Wednesday: Aerobic Fitness Primarily organized by SPC Shoemaker, and typically a run at Aerobic Threshold effort. This is a high tempo, yet sustainable pace. Runs beyond 30 minutes are ideal stimulus and should be executed with near even splits. Overtime we expect to see more speed / distance at the same intensity (Aerobic Adaptation). Alternatively we can do a hike, ERG row, stationary bike, or continuous basketball day.<br>Friday: Work Capacity This is where we combine Max Strength &amp; Aerobic Fitness for an up-tempo workout that bleeds into Anaerobic effort. This can be circuit training, HIIT, Every Minute on the Minute, or an Indian Run. It is the least structured workout and is meant to be a group challenge that simulates the dynamic work we must do on the fire line.<br> The most fit members of the crew can easily incorporate the M/W/F workouts into their programming. For the crew member that does no PT beyond what is prescribed, we expect to still see improvement via "beginner gains". SPC Hammack's Push / Pull / Leg specific workouts will allow less experienced lifters to learn new lifts do their own strength sessions. Likewise runs prescribed at Aerobic Threshold pace will give lesser runners a reprieve from crew runs that are too fast, while still giving them ideal stimulus to improve.<br><br>When organizing a PT session, it is simplest to assign the same workout to everyone. Given the variance in ability among the crew, this strategy violates Principal #6: All workouts must explicitly target either Strength, Aerobic Fitness, or Work Capacity. Why is this?<br>Let's say the crew is assigned a 4 mile run at 9'30" / mi pace. For the most capable runner on the crew, this pace is well below their Aerobic Threshold pace of 7'45" / mi. For the worst runner they will quickly exceed their aerobic limit and fall off the pace, despite giving their max effort. Both are receiving a sub-optimal stimulus in opposite directions. And for the crew member who went anaerobic, the stimulus is unproductive: The "toxic, acidic environment in the muscles [from high-intensity workouts] inhibit the aerobic development we seek."<a data-footref="5" href="https://george-a-shoemaker.github.io/mhc1/about:blank#fn-5-6766478f9e2d48a0" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[5]</a><br>You can imagine a similar scenario for a strength workout with free weights: The strongest crew member can easily squat a barbell loaded with 250 lbs whereas an inexperienced lifter will risk injury by handling such weight. It's unproductive.<br>The worst possible result of overwhelming stimulus is over training or injury. This happens when the Stimulus-Fatigue (of SFRA Theory) compounds in the absence of Recovery-Adaption such that P (Performance) degrades in the long term. We can avoid this.<br><br>A straight forward solution to the above problems is to create workout-specific "teams" based on measured ability.<br>Let's reframe the 4 mile crew run from above: We want the crew to run approximately 40 minutes at a pace that is close to their Aerobic Threshold. Let's split thew crew into Alpha, Bravo &amp; Charlie groups. Alpha will run at 8' / mi for 5 miles. Bravo will run at 9'30" / mi for 4 miles. Charlie will run at 11' / mi for 3.5 miles. The variance in distance / pace of each group allows us to roughly normalize the 40 minutes of aerobic training stimulus for everyone.<br>We can determine the running teams by collecting 2 mi time trial results. We can then calculate and assign Aerobic Threshold paces and test if they are appropriate with feedback and GPS tracking.<br>Similarly for strength sessions, we can assign A/B/C groups based on measured 1 Rep Max for dynamic lifts. Taking a percentage of that result allows us to determine the team's training weight for a given movement. We can employ Progressive Overload by increasing that percentage over time.<br>To ensure the training groups are split correctly and that assigned workouts are effective, we will need to constantly receive feedback and adjust. Maybe the training weight was too easy for an individual, and they should move up a group. Maybe the group as a whole has improved, and they are ready for a modest increase in weight. Within a group stronger individuals can bump up the reps so long as they are capable of completing all the assigned sets.<br>While the Strength and Aerobic Fitness sessions should be split into teams, I envision the Work Capacity workouts to be done together as a crew, doubling as a teamwork and morale building exercise.<br><br>For much of the crew the M/W/F programming is not enough to continue progressing. The frequency of stimulus isn't there so additional runs and lifts throughout the week would flesh out the training. To help people focus their efforts we can ask what their individual fitness goals are and check in with them periodically. Example goals could be to bench press one's body weight for 1 rep, run the 2 mile in 14 minutes, or do 1 rep of 1.5x bodyweight for the Back Squat, etc..<br>By hitting the three major workouts weekly, tailoring stimulus via workout teams, and promoting a culture of regular and purposeful training, we can become a more competitive, durable, and capable crew.<br><br>
<br>Start the M/W/F workout cycle.
<br>Create groups and plan workouts with available info.
<br>Execute the 1 Rep Max Day &amp; 2 Mile Test Day to calculate training figures.
<br>Continuously monitor and adjust programming based on individual and team progress / feedback.
<br>Collect personal fitness goals. Periodically monitor progress.
<br>Repeat the 1 Rep Max Day and 2 Mile Test Day every 3 months.
<br>1 Rep Max Day  <br>
<br>Goal: Test individuals' 1 Rep Max as input for A/B/C training teams and computed training weight.
<br>Training weight calculation:

<br>Take the 1 rep and multiply it by some percentage in the range of 50-80%.
<br>For example a 1 Rep Max of 220lbs at 70% yields a training weight of ~150lbs.
<br>The percentage will increase over time as the team adapts (Progressive Overload).


<br>Procedure

<br>Warm up specific to the movement
<br>Coaching on the movement
<br>Break out into groups to test 1 Rep Max for:

<br>Bench Press
<br>Back Squat
<br>(Hex Bar) Dead Lift 




<br>2 Mile Test Day  <br>
<br>Goal: Measure relative running ability as input for A/B/C training teams and computed Aerobic Threshold training pace.
<br>Aerobic Threshold training pace calculation:

<br>Plug the 2 mile time into the Luke Humphrey Running Pace Calculator<a data-footref="6" href="https://george-a-shoemaker.github.io/mhc1/about:blank#fn-6-6766478f9e2d48a0" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[6]</a> and record the faster limit of the "Moderate" pace output.
<br>For example a 14 minute 2 mile will yield a "Moderate" pace output of 9'10" / mi pace for the faster limit.


<br>Procedure

<br>1 mile warm up and dynamic stretches
<br>Set up timers and course (ideally at a track)
<br>Run 2 mi at max effort
<br>Record times
<br>Cool down


<br><br>Max Strength: Push Day<br>

<br>Morning was time constrained. EMOM set up / break down is quick. Hammack’s EMOM music track is helpful. Crew enjoys the workout, high tempo but attainable for everyone.<br><br>Max Strength assessment<br>Hammack's self assessment:<br><br>
<br>First formation dismissal: gave time to prep gym
<br>Technique instruction and how to safely fail a lift: Gave people confidence to try their best while avoiding injury
<br>Non-formal "coaching" approach: Allowed Hammack to engage with crew in an approachable, encouraging way. Environment is non judgemental and safe for everyone.
<br>Shoemaker acting as scribe: Allowed Hammack to give people attention as needed.
<br><br>   • Elaborate on the the importance of rest between warm ups / sets / 1 rep max attempts<br>
<br>Better crowd control: Some time spent in "bro session" mode, Bravo entered the gym and side tracked Alpha.
<br>A more in depth class on technique prior to the session: Would cut down the time to complete the assessment
<br><br>Aerobic Fitness assessment<br><a data-href="2mi-results" href="https://george-a-shoemaker.github.io/mhc1/2mi-results" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2mi-results</a><br>I estimate the course is 10 sec slower than a track (slope, hard turn around). Placed pink flagging at turn around.<br>Before the assessment I asked people their “best guess” for a 2 mile time for two reasons:<br>
<br>Hammack thought self-reported times would overestimate performance. This was largely correct - average guess was 10% faster than recorded time.
<br>My hope was that by stating a goal time, people would take the assessment more seriously and try to hit that time.

 <br>18JAN2025<br>
<br>Determine if there is a new clone
<br>Collect your radios and find the Radio Clone desk (homies with the laptops)
<br>Before handing over your radios turn them ON &amp; remove lapel mics
<br>Ask which zones have new channels and tell your radio users
<br>For example at Palisades they loaded Zones 51 &amp; 52 with channels. Channels from a cloned zone should match your assigned channels in the IAP (tactical, command, etc).<br>Q1: What actually is a clone?<br>A1: As the radio user I can only edit Zones 1-9 by pulling channels from Zone 10 and above. Higher zones are apparently fixed and uneditable. A “clone” loads channels into an otherwise fixed zone. You need a laptop with authenticated BK Radio software to do this.<br>Q2: How can I tell if my radios have the current cloned zones?<br>A2: The cloned zones have a label. For example at Palisades on 17JAN2025 the zones are labelled “PALIS-E2” &amp; “PALIS-W2”. Each new clone will have unique zone labels (such as PALIS-E3/4/5 etc). Ask at the Radio Clone desk for the current zone labels if you are unsure.]]></description><link>https://george-a-shoemaker.github.io/mhc1/knowledge/radios/radio-clone-instructions.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">knowledge/radios/radio-clone-instructions.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[George Shoemaker]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 20:33:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Radio Questions]]></title><description><![CDATA[
